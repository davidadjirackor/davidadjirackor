- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Im David. I have a passion for building databases and i have been doing it for a while mostly with Oracle tools. In recent times, Im looking to up skill myself

focusing mainly on Back-End & API technologies. I believe a combination of that and my great SQL skills will be flames ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ for my skillset. The aim is to have a lot of work with skills Im learning and the ones i already have. 

I also have skill in project/task management building with ClickUp. I have a youtube videos showing tutorials on how to understand & use it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRC7Imvufi0)

When i am not writing code you will find me producing and editing podcasts for a podcast network (https://listentogcr.com) & enjoying life.
